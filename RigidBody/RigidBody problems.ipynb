    "(g) Now model a coin, which has a thickness very small compared to the radius.  Analytically compute the moments of inertia assuming the \"thin\" direction is $\\widehat{z}$.  Try using different initial angular velocities and integrate our equations to find its rotation. You may wish to throw a coin in the air a few times to get some intuition for what you expect!"

    "(h) In the previous questions, we assumed that objects rotate freely in zero-gravity, e.g. in free-fall on the ISS. We also assumed that they rotate freely in the presence of gravity when thrown in the air. However, they don't rotate freely in the presence of gravity when, e.g. resting on a table. What exactly does it mean for something to rotate freely, and where does this difference in behaviour come from?"
