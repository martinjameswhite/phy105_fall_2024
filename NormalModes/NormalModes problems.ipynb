    "### Dynamics of a Two-Mass, Three-Spring Coupled Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theoretical Background\n",
    "The two-mass, three-spring coupled oscillator is a classic problem in physics and engineering, illustrating fundamental concepts in dynamics and vibrational analysis. This system consists of two masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) connected by three springs ($k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$) in a linear arrangement (say along the $x$-axis).  The first spring connects to a rigid wall on the left and mass $1$ on the right.  The second spring connects masses $1$ and $2$ and the third spring connects to mass $2$ on the left and a rigid wall on the right. The behavior of this system can be understood through the principles of mechanics and vibration theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, each mass is subject to forces exerted by the springs. These forces depend on the spring constants and the relative displacements of the masses. When displaced from their equilibrium positions, the masses oscillate, and the nature of these oscillations can reveal much about the system's properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "IF we assemble the displacements of the two masses into a vector, $\\vec{x}$, their kinetic energy can be written $(1/2)\\dot{\\vec{x}}^T M \\dot{\\vec{x}}$ for a $2\\times 2$ mass matrix $M$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  T = \\frac{1}{2}m_1\\dot{x}_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2\\dot{x}_2^2\n",
    "    = \\frac{1}{2} (\\dot{x}_1,\\dot{x}_2)\n",
    "    \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} m_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & m_2 \\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\dot{x}_1 \\\\ \\dot{x}_2 \\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The potential energy is determined by the \"spring constant matrix\", $K$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  V = \\frac{1}{2}k_1 x_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_2(x_2-x_1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_3x_2^2\n",
    "    = \\frac{1}{2} (x_1,x_2)\n",
    "    \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} k_1+k_2 & -k_2 \\\\ -k_2 & k_2+k_3 \\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that both the kinetic and potential energy are quadratic forms, so the equations of motion (Euler-Lagrange equations) form a linear system -- $M\\dot{\\vec{x}}=K\\vec{x}$ -- which we solve in the usual way by trying $\\vec{x}(t)\\propto\\exp[i\\omega t]$.  This reduces our physics problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem, and we can immediately make use of the very sophisticated methods that exist for solving such problems.  It certainly beats doing it by hand, as we did in lecture!"
